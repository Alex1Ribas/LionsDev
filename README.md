# 🦁 LionsDev - Repositório de Exercícios e Projetos Node.js & MongoDB

## Overview
This repository documents my **full backend development journey**, covering **10 modules of progressive learning** and a **fullstack TCC project**.  

From **basic JavaScript logic and CLI exercises** to **database-driven applications with Express, MongoDB, JWT authentication, and frontend integration**, this portfolio demonstrates **structured learning, problem-solving, and professional application development**.

The projects are organized in modules to show **step-by-step evolution**, making it clear how I progressed from fundamentals to full production-ready systems.

- Middleware usage and async/await
- Error handling, status codes, environment variables
- API testing with Postman / Insomnia

### Module 10 – Full Backend Systems with MongoDB
- Migration from in-memory arrays to **MongoDB**
- MVC architecture with Models, Controllers, Services, Repositories
- JWT authentication, bcrypt password hashing
- Role-based access control and protected routes
- CRUD operations, async operations, and error handling
- Multiple real-world projects: scheduling, stock management, FlashCards, rentals, authentication

### TCC – Personal Finance Management System (Fullstack)
- Complete backend with **Express, MongoDB, MVC, JWT, bcrypt**
- Full CRUD for users, expenses, income, and financial reports
- Modular architecture with repositories, services, controllers, routes
- Input validation and centralized error handling
- Full Jest testing coverage (unit and integration tests)
- Frontend built with FlutterFlow interacting with the backend
- Production-ready fullstack system

---

## Technologies
- Node.js & JavaScript
- Express.js
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- JWT & bcrypt
- CLI interaction (`readline`, `prompt-sync`)
- dotenv for environment configuration
- Jest for testing
- FlutterFlow for frontend (TCC project)

---

## Learning Outcomes
- From **basic JS logic to full backend systems**
- Modular code architecture
- Asynchronous programming and error handling
- REST API design and testing
- Authentication, authorization, and role-based access
- Database design with MongoDB and Mongoose
- End-to-end fullstack development

---

## Notes
This repository is designed to **demonstrate growth and skill development** over time.  
Each module builds upon the previous one, culminating in a **professional fullstack project** (TCC) that integrates backend, database, security, and frontend.

It is suitable for:
- Portfolio presentation
- Job interviews
- Showcasing backend and fullstack capabilities
