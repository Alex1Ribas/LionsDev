# LionsDev

Backend development learning repository structured to demonstrate technical progression from foundational concepts to a complete fullstack application.
This repository documents the evolution of my backend development skills throughout a structured training program, organized by modules to clearly reflect growth in complexity and architectural understanding.

---

## 🚀 Technical Skills Demonstrated

By the end of this repository, I am capable of building:

* RESTful APIs using Node.js
* Modular backend architecture
* CRUD operations with database integration
* Authentication and authorization (JWT-based)
* Middleware-based request handling
* Error handling strategies
* Environment configuration
* Basic fullstack integration

---

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized into modules:

```
modules-01 → modules-10
```

Each module represents a stage of progression, from foundational JavaScript and Node.js concepts to more advanced backend architecture and fullstack implementation.

Each module contains a dedicated `README.md` explaining its focus and objectives.

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

The original implementation logic from each module was intentionally preserved.

Rather than refactoring earlier code to “improve” it retroactively, the goal was to maintain visibility of:

* Problem-solving evolution
* Architectural growth
* Increasing code organization
* Improved naming and structural decisions over time

This allows readers to observe technical maturity developing progressively.

---

## 🏗 Final Project (TCC)

The final module consolidates the main concepts into a fullstack application, including:

* Backend API
* Authentication
* Database integration
* Organized route/controller structure

This project represents the culmination of the technical foundations built throughout the course.

---

## 🔄 Repository Refactor

The repository was later reorganized to improve clarity and structure:

* Standardized naming conventions (English only)
* Reorganized directories into progressive modules
* Added documentation to contextualize each stage
* Minimal code adjustments were made only when required to preserve functionality after restructuring

No significant business logic was altered.

## 📈 What This Repository Represents

This repository is not just a collection of exercises.

It represents:

* Structured learning
* Increasing architectural awareness
* Backend development fundamentals
* Code organization maturity
* Commitment to continuous improvement

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB
* JWT
* Git

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add automated tests
* Improve API documentation
* Introduce containerization (Docker)
* Enhance architectural separation (services layer, etc.)
