# Module 02 – JavaScript Control Flow and User Input

## Description
This module introduces **user interaction in Node.js** and control flow statements in JavaScript. You will see how to take input from the terminal, process it, and control program execution using `if/else` and `switch` statements. These exercises reinforce the logic needed for interactive applications.

## Projects / Exercises

### 1. `01_guessingGame.js`
- **Learning focus:** User input/output and basic game logic.
- **Concepts practiced:**
  - Importing libraries using `require`
  - Using the `readline` library for terminal input
  - Generating random numbers with `Math.random()`
  - Converting strings to integers with `parseInt()`
  - Conditional logic with `if/else`
  - Exiting the program with `process.exit()`

### 2. `02_ifCalculator.js`
- **Learning focus:** Building a simple calculator with conditional statements.
- **Concepts practiced:**
  - Reading user input with `readline`
  - Performing arithmetic operations
  - Decision making using `if/else`

### 3. `03_switchCalculator.js`
- **Learning focus:** Using `switch/case` statements for cleaner conditional logic.
- **Concepts practiced:**
  - Reading user input with `readline`
  - Using `switch` to handle multiple cases
  - Performing arithmetic operations based on user choice

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- JavaScript

## How to Run
1. Open your terminal in the project folder.
2. Run any of the JavaScript files with Node.js:
   ```bash
   node 01_guessingGame.js
   node 02_ifCalculator.js
   node 03_switchCalculator.js
